      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>&#9835; Music</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions.
        My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are
        recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was
        played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and
        start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system
        would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down
        whenever I cried.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Music gives me the needed refuge whenever I feel like my head is
        spinning and I just want to shut out everything around me. The good
        thing about music is that there is music for every occasion and feeling.
        Whenever I feel depressed, I listen to sad songs. They guide me and keep
        me company during those trying moments. Whenever I'm happy, I have a
        collection of party songs that I dance to for hours to amplify the good
        feeling. The beauty of music is that it can be incorporated with other
        hobbies. For instance, I love reading a good book, as nice orchestra
        music is playing in the background.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Another good thing about music is that it is universal. You do not have
        to understand what the musician is saying for you enjoy it. If it makes
        you feel good, then it is worth listening to it. I'm naturally open
        minded when it comes to music. I have an extensive collection of music
        that transcends across many genres all over the globe. It wouldn't come
        as a surprise therefore to find several African songs in my phone that I
        really rock with and have no idea what they are talking about. However,
        I connect more with Country and Rock music.

      <h2>&#9992; Travelling</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset
        button in our lives. You go away for a few days or weeks and come back
        fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to
        many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation
        activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to.
        Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I
        used the word 'escapists' not in the literary sense of the word, but
        rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Travelling is a
        hobby like any other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another can
        be categorized together with fun activities like watching movies,
        swimming, dancing or drawing. While it has more challenges than other
        hobbies, it is more adventurous and brings the same level of
        satisfaction or more for those who love it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I occasionally go for vacations for the sole reason of learning
        different cultures and interacting with different people to get ideas
        for my literary work. Furthermore, being away from home really makes you
        appreciate it even more. The feeling you get after a vacation when you
        settle down on your couch and just relax is priceless. Travelling makes
        you appreciate people, their cultures and above all, it makes you
        appreciate your life and the little you have.
